# JavaFX Refresher

Testing ground for getting back into JavaFX development

JavaFX was removed from the Oracle API a while ago, so now it's a separate standalone download. Now it's OpenJFX. I found it frustrating that they removed it, which makes JavaFX setup a little more complicated, and it also causes issues with compatibility with JavaFX programs written in JavaFX, so I haven't used it in a while. This repo is just me re-learning JavaFX, since I haven't used it in a while, and the setup process is a little different from before.
